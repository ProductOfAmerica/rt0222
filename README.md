# RT0222

### Tests

Please see [CheckoutServiceTests.java](https://github.com/ProductOfAmerica/rt0222/blob/master/src/test/java/com/rt0222/service/CheckoutServiceTests.java) for the proof scenarios.

### Print method

Because the "Rental Agreement should include a method that can print the above values as text to the console," I have
included a .toString() override inside of [RentalAgreement.java](https://github.com/ProductOfAmerica/rt0222/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rt0222/domain/model/RentalAgreement.java). This may be called to return a formatted string of the
Rental Agreement object.
