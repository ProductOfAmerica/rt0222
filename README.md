### Tests

Please see CheckoutServiceTests.java for the proof scenarios.

### Print method

Because the "Rental Agreement should include a method that can print the above values as text to the console," I have
included a .toString() override inside of RentalAgreement.java. This may be called to return a formatted string of the
Rental Agreement object.
